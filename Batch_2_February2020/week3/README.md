Appendix Week 3:
	Theoreticals:

		Week 1 Topics Reminded:
			-dense and conv network types, frameworks and tools, gans, structuring approaches to problems
		Week 2 Revisited:
			-sequential models, what is memory? lstms.
			-blackboard example: oil prices
				seq_len, delta, batch_size, window_stride_to_create_examples, inp out intersection
			-nlp theory
				nlp terms: document corpus vocab.

				DLnlp
					one_hot the words
					word embeddings, embedding layers
					attention, bert, elmo, gpt2
				MLnlp
					tfidf
					alongside word occurence matrix


			-problems: spam, question, translation, speech


		Week 3 Theory:
			- What is an autoencoder?
			- Other methods to encode decode. PCA, LDA. 

			- What is reconstruction loss?
			- Anomaly detection. Uses in industry.

			- Real time data acquisition. 
			- Iot, Cloud computing, edge computing.
			- Arduino, ibm watson iot, node red.

			- Distributed computing. Frameworks, usages.
			- Databases etc for distributed computing

			- Light AI
				embedding models to chips
				compressing models
				models learning from other models
